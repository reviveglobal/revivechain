# REVIVE CHAIN

## Introduction to Revive
Revive (IVE) main Coin REVIVE CHAIN Networks. REVIVE CHAIN is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high.  Revive it adopts the POA consensus mechanism. REVIVE will continue to improve the efficiency of Ethereum by Layer2, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Vision
We have witnessed the growth process of great projects with fast Transaction. Therefore, Revive's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## REVIVE Performance
- TPS: 2000+
- Average block interval: 2s

## Consensus Mechanism
POA consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

## Economic Model 
The transactions consume IVE as gas fee.

Miners pledge IVE to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 

## REVIVE Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize usersâ€™ experience.
